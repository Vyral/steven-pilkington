I’m here today to shatter some common myths that home sellers are often fooled by. There are three, in particular, that I’d like to debunk for you sellers out there.

**1. You can do it on your own.** Because we all know our own home more intimately than anyone else, some sellers think they’re better off going the For Sale by Owner (FSBO) route. Most sellers have an emotional attachment to their home, and therein lies the problem with this approach.&nbsp;

A professional Realtor can help by giving you an emotionally removed perspective and providing you with greater resources than you’d have as an FSBO. The National Association of Realtors says that, at any given time, 20% of homes on the market in the U.S. are FSBO; yet, this approach accounts for a paltry 2% to 3% of sales each year. If you’re looking for a greater likelihood of success, don’t go it alone.

**2. You know exactly what your home is worth.** As we know, online home estimate tools are in abundance. If you look a little closer, the fine print will tell you that most of those estimates can be off by as much as 15% to 20%, up or down. Unless an estimate that wide of the mark is okay with you, I wouldn’t rely too heavily on online estimate calculators.&nbsp;

And certain factors like square footage, conditions, the overall landscape of the market, etc., often go unaccounted for by a non-professional. Do your homework and speak to a professional so you don’t run the risk of leaving thousands of dollars on the table.&nbsp;

**3. You don’t need to make improvements or you should remodel your entire home.** Admittedly, there are scenarios where either could be in your best interest. Before arriving at that decision, though, again, I can’t stress enough how important it is to speak to a professional; they’ll help you understand trends that are causing homes to sell and identify improvements that will give you the greatest bang for your buck. Seeking the advice of an agent may save you tens of thousands of dollars on needless remodeling costs. Conversely, your agent’s guidance may help you earn a higher ROI by means of putting a little work and money into your property.&nbsp;
