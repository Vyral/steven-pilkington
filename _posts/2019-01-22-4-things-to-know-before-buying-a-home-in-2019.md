Before the home buying process even begins, there are a few things you need to know:

**1. How much can you afford?** The best way to find out is to speak with a lender. Though there are many services online that can calculate it for you, nothing beats the accuracy and knowledge of a professional lender.&nbsp;

**2. What’s going on with interest rates.** 2018 had a lot of interest rate movement, and we’re expecting rates to move upward throughout 2019. In fact, the Fed said they’re looking to increase rates twice this year. Though interest rates are down at the moment, we don’t know how long this will last.&nbsp;

**3. How much do you need for a down payment?** It depends on the loan program you choose. Speak with your lender to see the options available to you; they range from zero down all the way up to the traditional 20% down.&nbsp;

**4. How long does it take to purchase a property?** In the Denver Metro area, it usually takes 30 to 60 days from the time you write the contract to the time you close on the home. Ideally, you should work in a couple of extra months so you can get familiar with what homes are out there.
