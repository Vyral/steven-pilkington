2018 has come and gone, so now is the perfect opportunity to take a final look at last year’s numbers and discuss the relationship between the cycles real estate goes through and the outlook for 2019. &nbsp;

Though a slowdown of activity in real estate along with the stock market’s recent slide has dominated the news, our local market in 2018 actually went out on a high note. **On average, home values were up 7.8% year over year;** some neighborhoods even topped out at a 14% price increase and, still, others only saw a gain of 1% or 2%.&nbsp;

In short, this spelled good news for almost every homeowner in 2018. Now, let’s look at what’s in front of us for 2019.&nbsp;

**Economists’ opinions on what this year might bring are certainly not unanimous—some tell us that the Denver real estate market could be flat in 2019, while others assert that we might experience a 3% to 4% upsurge in value.** No matter which scenario unfolds, good news could be on the way.&nbsp;

“How can both outcomes potentially be good news?” you may ask.&nbsp;

Well, **real estate runs in cycles, and those cycles are patterned on historical numbers.** Though we never know what will happen for sure, it gives us a good idea of what to look for. Real estate cycles run through four main phases; when a new cycle begins, the first phase will start out on a “top” and finish at the next top with the last phase.&nbsp;

From one peak to the next, a real estate cycle will routinely last around seven years. In Denver, it can be argued that our last peak arrived somewhere between late 2005 and mid-2006. That’s just shy of 14 years of a positive cycle!&nbsp;

**After a long peak like this, we can expect that to slip into a gradual decline at some point.** The eventual bottom we’ll hit affords buyers the best opportunity to take action in the market.&nbsp;

With all of this in mind, we can’t say with the utmost confidence where 2019’s market is trending, but we know that we’re pressing our luck a bit. **If your goals for this year include investing in real estate, my word of caution is to be prepared for any and all possibilities that could come our way.&nbsp;**
