Decluttering has become more and more popular with homeowners, so today I’ll fill you in on a few things you can do to derive the most success out of your decluttering efforts.

**Find a coach.** Whether you choose to follow the advice of professional Organizing Consultant Marie Kondo or another expert in this vein, learning from a coach, finding a philosophy, and following a pattern will get you to where you want to go.

**Have a plan in place.** You might sift through photos from sites such as Houzz in order to formulate an idea of what you want the end product to look like. With each item you pick up, ask yourself one question: Does this particular thing spark joy in me? If not, be thankful for the time it served you and part with it.

**Sort through your clothes first.** If you’re like me, you have clothes that are seasonally specific, and some of those clothes have sat untouched in your closet for years. These should probably be the first to go. Other items could include books, boxed up papers and documents, old mementos, miscellaneous items, and, lastly, items that summon feelings of nostalgia.

A lot of times, we rationalize that we might need an item in the future, which only further contributes to clutter. For example, I recently discovered that my neighbor has a lot of the same tools that I might need, so now I check to see if I can borrow from them before going out and buying it. After all, it’s a lot easier to borrow something for an hour than to buy it and find a place to store it forever.

Next, **organize the storage.** This shouldn’t equate to stacking boxes on top of each other like it’s a game of Tetris. Look to have an organizational setup with pull-out drawers.

And finally, **consider donating gently used items that aren’t a source of joy for you.** There are plenty of organizations willing to accept your donation, and you’ll find joy in knowing that you have a cleaner space and that you brought joy to someone that could put the item to good use.

If you have any questions or there’s a topic you’d like to see covered in a future video, please reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon!
