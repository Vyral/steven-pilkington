Sometimes, moving to a smaller home is the right next step to make in life. There are many reasons you might want to downsize, but today we’ll cover just five of the most common:

**1. Retirement.** When you retire, you’re undoubtedly in for a major lifestyle change. The amount of time and income you have drastically changes at this point, so it only makes sense that your living situation should reflect this.&nbsp;

**2. Anxiety.** Some people assume that the natural progression of homeownership is an upward climb. They think that bigger means better, but this isn’t always true. In fact, having more space than you know what to do with can lead to a lot of apprehension. Simplifying your living situation through downsizing could actually improve your quality of life.&nbsp;

**3. Excessive space.** As we touched on in the previous point, having more space than necessary can be frustrating. Why waste time cleaning rooms you never spend time in? Unused space is generally more hassle than it’s worth.&nbsp;

**4. Financial opportunity.** If your home has appreciated since you first bought it and you’re ready to move on to something more compact, then downsizing can offer an incredible financial opportunity.&nbsp;

**5. Lifestyle.** If you’re someone who likes to travel, like many in our area do, downsizing to a smaller primary residence can open you up to getting a vacation home. Better still, you can also create extra cash flow with this property by renting it out while you’re away.&nbsp;
