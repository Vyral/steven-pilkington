Here are six tips that will help you save money on your winter heating bill:&nbsp;

**1. Change your furnace filter often.** Surprisingly enough, the best choice for your furnace filter is typically the cheapest one. The more expensive filters that take more particles out of the air tend to make your furnace work harder and typically don’t last as long. Some of the best HVAC professionals I know have advised me to order cheaper filters by the bundle and replace them once a month. For example, instead of buying one filter that costs $30, try buying 10 that cost $4 each.&nbsp;

**2. Clean your air ducts.** Air ducts have a tendency to accumulate a lot of gunk and grime over the years, so having them cleaned once a year (or once every three to five years) will allow air to move smoother throughout the house.

**3. Turn on your ceiling fans.** Did you know that most ceiling fans have a wintertime switch that reverses their rotation so that they keep hot air near the floor? Activating this switch and keeping your ceiling fans on will even out the temperature in your home and eliminate hot and cold spots.&nbsp;

**4. Have your HVAC unit professionally inspected.** When was the last time you had a professional check your HVAC unit to see that it was clean and running smoothly? The cost of this inspection can vary depending on how long it’s been since the last inspection, but it’s worth it. The sooner you can get it done, the longer your unit will last.&nbsp;

**5. Get a humidifier.** If you live here in the Denver metro area, you know that the air is dry. Getting a humidifier for your home and adding some humidity to the air will help your furnace a lot.&nbsp;

**6. Install a smart thermostat.** You can program smart thermostats to regulate the air temperature of your home while you’re away, and they can also automatically adjust your home’s temperature according to the temperature outside.&nbsp;
